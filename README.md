Backend for Feynman/Ficus project. Source ES6 code is transformed into es5 using 6to5 module.
Uses SockJS as WebSocket protocol implementation.

Currently this is in an early prototype stage, so don't expect it to be hugely useful :)

Note: at the moment `npm install` fails because of [this issue in 6to5](https://github.com/6to5/6to5/issues/137).
Hopefully it will be resolved soon.
